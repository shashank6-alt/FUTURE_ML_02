By Akshay Posina
Machine Learning Internship | Future Interns

📍 Overview
This project predicts which customers are likely to stop using a service (churn) using the XGBoost machine learning model. 
It helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive actions to improve retention.

📂 Files Included
1. Customer_Churn.csv – Original dataset containing customer and account details.
2. Churn_prediction.py – Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Churn_Predictions.csv – Model output file containing churn probability for each customer.
4. Feature_Importance.csv – Feature importance values extracted from XGBoost.
5. Task-2_Customer_Churn_Akshay_Posina.pbix – Power BI dashboard visualizing key churn insights and metrics.

⚙️ Model Workflow
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
- Encoded categorical features and scaled numeric data.
- Trained an XGBoost Classifier on the processed dataset.
- Evaluated the model using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
- Exported results to CSV for Power BI visualization.
